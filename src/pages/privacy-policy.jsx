Google Analytics This site may use Google Analytics tools and advertising features. Google Analytics Advertising Features allow features in Analytics that aren’t available through standard implementations. Advertising features include: Remarketing with Google Analytics Google Display Network Impression Reporting Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting Integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers The Advertising Features enable Google Analytics to collect data about website traffic via Google advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, in addition to data collected through a standard Google Analytics implementation.

Your use of the Sites will not facilitate the merging of personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature unless you have robust notice of, and the user’s prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.

Please note that we will review such requests on a case-by-case basis and make all determinations in our sole and absolute discretion. When you visit the Site, we and others give you the following choices about the use of mechanisms for tracking, including tracking of your online activities over time and across different websites and online services by third parties.

Please contact us atHello@HighTechHoldingsInc.com for a list of third-party service providers and advertisers. However, while we and others give you choices as described in this policy, there are many ways in which web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and the Sites may not be aware of or honor every mechanism. You may have the right to know what personal or Included Entity information Sweed Inc. has about you and to correct any inaccuracies. Please direct any such requests by email to Hello@HighTechHoldingsInc.com. In certain jurisdictions where we may operate, you may have the right under applicable law to: obtain confirmation that we hold personal information about you, request access to and receive information about the personal information we maintain about you, receive copies of the personal information we maintain about you, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal information, object to or restrict the processing of your personal information, under certain circumstances, provide instructions for the use of your personal information after death, request to have deleted any personal information collected at the time you qualified as a minor under applicable law, have your personal information blocked, anonymized or deleted, as appropriate; and withdraw any consent you previously provided to us regarding the use and processing of your personal information.</p>
                        <p>11. CHILDREN The Site is not intended for children under the age of 18. We will not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 18 and do not target our Site or Services to children under 18. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy. If you have any reason to believe that any child under the age of 18 has provided personal information to us through the Site, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases. Children Under 13 We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Site or Services we provide. However, we have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our Site or Services, and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for all users for which age is unknown. If a child, including any child under the age of 13, has provided us with personally-identifying information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information and opt out of promotional opportunities. Additionally, if you have any reason to believe that any child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us through the Sites, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
                        <p>12. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS If you are a resident of the state of California, the following rights are available to you under the California Consumer Privacy Act. Right to access You have the right to request that we disclose the categories of personal information collected, the categories of sources from which personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collection, the categories of third parties with which we share personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information that we have about you. You also have the right to request that we provide your personal information to you in a readily usable format. Right to request deletion You have the right to request that we delete personal information that we collected from you. Note, however, that certain requests to delete personal information may be denied if we are required to retain the information as a matter of law, the information is necessary for detecting security incidents, exercising free speech, protecting or defending against legal claims, or for internal uses reasonably aligned with consumer expectations, including transaction data. Right to non-discrimination You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of these privacy rights. We do not offer financial incentives related to the provision of data. Authorized agent You have the right to designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at Hello@HighTechHoldingsInc.com. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
                        <p>13. CHANGES AND UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY As noted above, from time to time, we may revise the Privacy Policy.
